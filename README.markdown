## Easily build C# without any editor what-so-ever
0. Download stfu.exe
1. stfu install (remove the downloaded exe)
2. stfu new your_project_name
3. stfu build

STFU! You're done.

## Built using STFU
Written in C#, for C#. 

## Inspired by Leiningen/Clojure
The product of an Alt.NET programmer crossing community lines to innovate.

## Tell Visual Studio to STFU
STFU has been built by combining STFU and VIM via command line. Building C# via the command line has never been this easy. Tell Visual Studio to STFU, it's time to code.

# What's Next?

## Testing
In the immediate future I will add NUnit support out of the box (for all tests in the tests folder). In the medium term, I want to be able to use different testing frameworks.

## Web Framework Compatibility
Which one? The one that doesn't require Visual Studio and let's me STFU and get work done.

## Nuget Integration and Distribution
Pull STFU from Nuget so it's easier to get. Of course STFU will be published to Nuget using STFU (Nuget publishing will come first).

## WPF
Because we all only code in Xaml anyway.

## ILMerge capabilities
Ease deployment and distribution of your code.

## Github Integration
Create a new repo on project creation and have it automatically provisioned and ready to be pulled and pushed from.
